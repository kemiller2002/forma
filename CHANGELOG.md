# Changelog

Forma follows semantic versioning for its public HTML, class, and token
contracts (`requirements/QUALITY-AND-DISTRIBUTION.md`, QD-004). Releases are
published as GitHub release tarballs
(`https://github.com/kemiller2002/forma/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/echelon-foundry-design-system-X.Y.Z.tgz`)
and to npm. Earlier releases are described in `docs/CONSUMING-FORMA.md` and
`HANDOFF.md`.

## 0.6.1

Patch release: responsive navigation and native date/time field containment.
- Site navigation labels no longer break mid-word or overlap the header at tablet sizes, mobile widths, or larger text scales. Navigation reflows into its own bounded, keyboard-accessible horizontal scroll region.
- Shared native date, time, and datetime-local fields constrain their intrinsic width within grid columns, including Safari, without replacing the browser picker.
- Documentation example previews and code snippets scroll within their own containers instead of widening the page.
- Documentation navigation now highlights only the current section, with `aria-current="page"` on section index pages and `aria-current="location"` on descendants; the Agent use link is not a permanently highlighted call-to-action.
- Adds generated-page and WebKit responsive tests at eight widths, including the reported date-time-field examples and enlarged text.

No public icon identifiers, assets, or component semantics were renamed.

## 0.6.0

Additive icon-library expansion: **80 icons in total**, up from 40, with no changes to existing icon identifiers or their geometry.

### Added
- Email and collaboration: `email`, `email-open`, `inbox`, `send`, `reply`, `reply-all`, `forward`, `attachment`, `message`, `chat`, `phone`, `video-call`.
- Common actions: `archive`, `bookmark`, `link`, `unlink`, `share`, `star`, `eye`, `eye-off`, `minus`, `more-vertical`, `maximize`, `minimize`.
- Documents and media: `file-text`, `image`, `camera`, `video`, `microphone`, `clipboard`.
- Navigation and places: `chevron-left`, `chevron-right`, `map-pin`, `globe`, `compass`.
- Status and assistance: `info`, `error`, `help-circle`, `pending`, `wifi-off`.

Each new icon includes a canonical source geometry definition, search metadata, standalone and inert inline SVG build outputs, dedicated usage guidance, accessible action examples, and a generated individual documentation page. Icons remain static, offline, brand-neutral, `currentColor`-based, and safe for print.

### Validation
- Extended source-contract tests protect the previous 40 IDs, new icon names, distinct messaging glyphs and safe geometry.
- Expanded browser coverage checks labelled native message controls at 320px and static embedding of the complete registry.
- Source/documentation parity remains mandatory for every icon.

Consumer migration is opt-in. Apps pinned to 0.5.0 will not automatically acquire the new artwork. Publish 0.6.0 only after Praxis, package, site, accessibility and browser CI pass.

## 0.5.0

Additive minor release: Forma's static icon system. Forma core remains
zero-runtime; no existing HTML class or token contract was renamed, so no
consumer migration is required.

### Added

- **`ef-icon` catalog pattern** (`patterns/icon.html`): decorative inline SVG
  inside a natively named control. The SVG is `aria-hidden` and never names,
  operates or signals state on its own.
- **40 original, brand-neutral outline icons** in `icons/registry.json`
  (24-unit grid, 1.8 stroke, round caps and joins), validated by
  `schemas/icon-registry.schema.json` and compiled at build time by
  `tools/icons/build.mjs`. Third-party geometry, scripts, external `href`s and
  embedded media are rejected.
- **Package assets** under `@echelon-foundry/design-system/icons/*`:
  `icons/<name>.svg`, decorative `icons/html/<name>.html` snippets, and
  `icons/registry.json`. The compiled registry records `formaVersion` (the
  producing release) and each icon's `svgSha256`, so consumers can pin and
  verify bundled release geometry offline.
- **Generated icon gallery** at `/icons/` on the documentation site.
- Tests for deterministic compilation, offline/static output, SVG security,
  accessibility, forced colors, and 320px layout.

Studio and Folio pin 0.5.0 only after this version is published and their own
end-to-end verification passes.

## 0.4.1

Patch release. There are no markup, class, or token-name changes, so no
consumer migration is required.

### Fixed

- **WCAG AA contrast on the secondary surface (FORMA-A11Y-002).** Body,
  severity, reference, hint, and link text inside components that paint
  `--ef-color-surface-secondary` now meets 4.5:1 in every theme and brand.
  Affected components include `.ef-fault--inline`, `.ef-surface`, assistant
  conversation turns, file drop zones, master-detail rows, evidence-age rows,
  and checked choices. Previously, text inside them used `text-secondary` or
  an accent role. For example, inline-fault text was `#686d68` on `#e3e0d7`,
  4.0:1. Every rule that paints the secondary surface now rebinds secondary
  and muted text to `text-on-secondary-surface`, and links and accent labels
  to `text-primary`, through the new `--ef-surface-accent-text-color` hook.
  Consumer workarounds such as `.operational-fault p { color: inherit }` can
  be removed.
- **Forced colors.** In Chromium, ibm-3270 character-grid text was painted in
  the profile palette on the forced white Canvas, at 1.1 to 2.4:1. Profile
  tokens now resolve to system colors under `forced-colors: active`.
- **Built CSS.** Forma 0.3.0 shipped a literal `\n` before
  `.ef-surface :where(h1, …, p)` in `foundations.css` and `all.css`, so that
  rule never applied. The source was corrected in 0.4.0. 0.4.1 adds a check of
  the built output that would have caught it.

### Added checks

- `tests/browser/pattern-contrast.spec.mjs` runs axe color-contrast over every
  documented pattern, in every theme, every brand (light and dark), and forced
  colors.
- `tests/contrast-pairs.test.mjs` checks documented token pairs and
  secondary-surface pairing for every compiled theme and brand.
- `tests/dist-css.test.mjs` parses every built stylesheet and fails on stray
  escape sequences, unbalanced blocks, selectors that name nonexistent
  elements, and composed outputs whose selectors differ from their sources.
