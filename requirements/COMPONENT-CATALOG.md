# Component and Pattern Catalog Requirements

This catalog defines capability requirements. The canonical design-system package is HTML and CSS only.

An entry may be:

- a **declarative pattern** fully implemented by semantic HTML + CSS;
- a **visual contract** whose behavior is supplied by Limen/application code;
- native HTML styled by the foundation layer.

Every implemented pattern also exposes a public authoring wrapper named `<ef-{slug}>`, for example `<ef-switch>`, `<ef-dialog>`, and `<ef-data-grid>`.

These `ef-*` tags are intentionally **inert custom HTML wrappers**, not registered Custom Elements:

- Forma does not call `customElements.define()`;
- the wrapper uses `class="ef-component-tag"` and `display: contents` so it does not become a competing layout box;
- native HTML inside the wrapper remains the semantic, form, keyboard, focus, dialog, popover, and accessibility authority;
- Limen/application code still owns non-native behavior;
- the wrapper exists to provide a stable, readable component authoring surface and consistent documentation syntax.

The existing `.ef-*` classes remain the styling/pattern contract used by the canonical inner markup.

Inclusion here does not mean every entry must ship in the first release.

Priority meanings:

- **P0**: foundation required for the first usable release.
- **P1**: common application capability that should follow soon.
- **P2**: advanced capability justified by real product needs.
- **P3**: specialized capability that requires evidence before implementation.

## Cross-cutting mobile and reflow requirements

These requirements apply to every shipped pattern, including advanced visual
contracts whose behavior is supplied by Limen/application code.

- The canonical pattern must remain contained at 320 CSS pixels and wider.
- Responsive presentation must not create page-level horizontal scrolling.
- Standalone controls and delegated label targets should expose approximately a
  44 by 44 CSS pixel touch target where practical.
- Layout changes may stack, wrap, collapse, or introduce component-contained
  scrolling, but must preserve semantic order and accessible relationships.
- Horizontal scrolling is acceptable only when the information model genuinely
  depends on a horizontal continuum or table; the scroll region must remain
  contained and keyboard reachable when needed.
- Hover, drag, precise pointer input, color, and motion may enhance interaction
  but may not be the sole usable path.
- Long labels, translated content, large text, and user-generated values must
  wrap or reflow rather than forcing viewport overflow.
- Dialogs, popovers, drawers, menus, and other transient surfaces must fit
  within the dynamic viewport and provide contained scrolling for long content.
- Mobile verification must cover at least 320px and 390px widths and must run
  against every canonical implemented pattern.

## 1. Native styled foundations

These are primarily CSS and semantic HTML, not custom elements.

### P0
- Typography and headings
- Paragraphs and prose
- Links
- Buttons and button groups
- Native checkbox and radio

## 2. Form and selection components

### P0: Checkbox
Pattern: `.ef-checkbox`

Requirements:

- native `input[type=checkbox]` remains semantic and form authority;
- delegated label target suitable for touch;
- visible non-color checked cue;
- required, disabled, reset, keyboard Space, and form behavior remain native;
- optional physics-derived light/standard/heavy presentation weight;
- motion never delays the checked state;
- reduced motion preserves the checked cue without perceptible spatial travel;
- assessment choice cards continue to use `.ef-choice` when the answer presentation needs richer assessment context.

### P0: Switch / toggle
Pattern: `.ef-switch`

Requirements:

- on/off semantic state;
- visible label support;
- optional explicit state text;
- disabled and readonly states;
- native form participation;
- keyboard Space activation;
- click/touch target includes label when appropriate;
- thumb translation animation using the shared physics-derived inertia model;
- optional light/standard/heavy presentation weights that never change semantics;
- track color interpolation;
- active press feedback;
- optional on-state glyph for compact contexts;
- no reliance on color alone;
- reduced-motion mode replaces travel animation with immediate state change or short opacity transition;
- controlled and uncontrolled presentation modes without inventing domain authority.

### P0: Slider
Pattern: `.ef-slider`

Requirements:

- single value;
- min, max, step;
- keyboard arrows, Page Up/Down, Home, End;
- pointer and touch direct manipulation;
- click-to-position where appropriate;
- labeled minimum/current/maximum;
- value tooltip or value label;
- tick marks and named stops;
- optional adjacent numeric input;

- RTL-aware behavior;
- track fill reflecting current value;
- thumb active-state scale or emphasis;
- value bubble entry/exit;
- snap feedback for discrete stops;
- reduced-motion support;
- no drag-only requirement for setting a value;
- form participation and validity.

### P1: Multi-range slider
Visual contract: `.ef-range-slider` (Limen behavior required)

Requirements:

- two or more thumbs where justified;
- non-crossing and crossing policy must be explicit;
- keyboard navigation for each thumb;
- accessible label/value for each thumb;
- minimum interval constraints;
- optional histogram or range context behind the track;
- direct entry fields as a non-drag alternative;
- collision behavior without inaccessible tiny targets.

### P0: Segmented control
Pattern: `.ef-segmented` using native radios

Requirements:

- single and, only when semantically correct, multi-select variants;
- keyboard arrow navigation;
- equal and content-sized segment modes;
- animated selection indicator;
- selection animation preserves orientation and supports reduced motion;
- icon plus text and text-only variants;
- overflow strategy instead of shrinking targets below usable size.

### P0: Select / listbox
Pattern: `.ef-select` around a native `select`

Native select shall remain available and preferred for ordinary selection.

Requirements:

- native select/options remain value, keyboard, form, validity, disabled, and picker authority;
- visible indicator may use CSS-only inertial rotation and gravity-derived vertical timing;
- optional light/standard/heavy presentation weight affects inertia only;
- gravity-derived timing is independent of mass;
- `:open` presentation is progressive enhancement and cannot be required for operation;
- reduced motion removes spatial travel;
- no runtime script is introduced to reproduce ordinary picker behavior.

A custom select is justified only where searchable, rich, or multi-select behavior is needed.

### P1: Combobox / autocomplete
Visual contract: `.ef-combobox` (Limen behavior required)

Requirements:

- editable and select-only modes where justified;
- async suggestions;
- loading, no-result, error, and stale-result handling;
- grouped options;
- optional rich option secondary text;
- keyboard behavior following the WAI-ARIA combobox pattern;
- composition/IME-safe input;
- typeahead;
- safe cancellation of obsolete async requests.

### P1: Multiselect
Visual contract: `.ef-multiselect` (Limen behavior required)

Requirements:

- selected value chips/tokens;
- keyboard removal and navigation;
- maximum-selection rule;
- "select all" only when scope is unambiguous;
- large-option-list performance;
- accessible summary of current selections.

### P1: Date picker and date-range picker
Visual contracts: `.ef-date-picker`, `.ef-date-range` (Limen behavior required)

Requirements:

- text entry must remain possible;
- locale-aware presentation without silently changing stored semantic value;
- keyboard grid navigation;
- disabled/unavailable dates;
- min/max constraints;
- range preview;
- preset ranges;
- month/year navigation;
- no drag-only range selection;
- clear errors for invalid or ambiguous input.

### P1: Time and date-time
Visual contracts: `.ef-time-picker`, `.ef-date-time` (Limen behavior required where native inputs are insufficient)

Support 12/24 hour presentation, timezone labeling where relevant, explicit ambiguity handling, and keyboard text entry.

### P1: Search
Visual contract: `.ef-search` (Limen behavior required for suggestions/async search)

Support debounce as an integration option, clear button, recent/query suggestions supplied by the application, keyboard shortcut affordance, pending state, and result count announcement.

### P1: File upload
Pattern: native file input; visual contract for upload queues requires Limen

Support:

- file picker;
- drop zone as enhancement, not sole path;
- multi-file mode;
- size/type constraints;
- progress;
- cancel;
- retry;
- duplicate detection supplied by application;
- unknown outcome;
- per-file error;
- keyboard accessibility.

### P0: Natural-language composer

Pattern: `.ef-composer`

Support a large plain-language input surface with visible context/help, native textarea semantics, application-supplied attach/dictate affordances, a primary continuation action, and an accessible status region.

Forma owns presentation only. Interpretation, agent invocation, speech recognition, upload behavior, persistence, permissions, and transition legality belong to the consuming application/Limen/Ordo. The composer must remain useful when no AI capability is available and must never imply that submitted text has already been committed.

### P1: Conversation

Pattern: `.ef-conversation` / `.ef-turn`

Render an ordered history of explicitly labeled user/application turns. Support structured content and application-supplied actions inside a turn without forcing consumer-chat bubbles. Speaker styling must not imply truth, authority, confidence, or approval.

### P1: Understanding review

Pattern: `.ef-understanding`

Present the application's proposed interpretation of user input before a consequential operation. Support explicit textual states including understood/accepted, unknown, conflicting, and unresolved; concise summaries; and source, answer, or correction actions supplied by the application. Ordo/application state is authoritative for every state and whether any item blocks a transition.

### P2: Tag / token input
Visual contract: `.ef-token-input` (Limen behavior required)

Support freeform or constrained tokens, keyboard editing, paste of multiple values, duplicate policy, validation, and accessible token removal.

### P2: Color picker
Visual contract: `.ef-color-picker` (Limen behavior required unless native color input suffices)

Only if product requirements justify it.

Support text values, swatches, alpha policy, contrast preview where relevant, keyboard operation, and non-spatial value entry. Color selection may not rely solely on a 2D pointer canvas.

## 3. Assessment, decision, and state patterns

These patterns were derived from Echelon Signal requirements but are intentionally application-independent.

### P0: Question shell
Pattern: `.ef-question`

Requirements:

- stable question/prompt region;
- optional question number that is not required for the accessible name;
- help/instruction text;
- required/optional communication supplied by the application;
- selector slot/body;
- validation region;
- conditional/hidden presentation supplied by application state;
- no scoring or applicability logic inside the design system.

### P0: Ordinal / Likert scale
Pattern: `.ef-ordinal-scale`

One pattern shall support discrete ordered scales such as:

- 3-point;
- 5-point;
- 7-point;
- agreement;
- frequency;
- quality;
- confidence;
- satisfaction;
- maturity/readiness;
- numeric discrete ratings.

Requirements:

- native radio inputs;
- fieldset/legend semantics;
- cardinality variants;
- equal-width horizontal presentation when space permits;
- stacked mobile presentation;
- strong selected and focus-visible states;
- selection not communicated by color alone;
- label text supplied by the application;
- keyboard behavior remains native radio-group behavior;
- reduced-motion support;
- special states such as Don't Know and Not Applicable rendered outside the ordinal continuum;
- no scoring semantics inferred from position or label.

Separate `Likert5`, `Agreement5`, `Frequency5`, and similar components shall not be created. They are application/presentation presets over the same ordinal pattern.

### P0: Choice group
Pattern: `.ef-choice-group` / `.ef-choice`

Support:

- single choice using radios;
- multi-choice using checkboxes;
- forced choice and pairwise choice through the same semantic primitives;
- primary and supporting option text;
- native required/disabled behavior;
- mobile/touch targets;
- selected and focus-visible states;
- no hidden score/meaning attached to visual order.

### P0: Special answer choices
Pattern: `.ef-special-choices` / `.ef-special-choice`

Use for semantic states that must not be confused with the primary answer scale, including:

- Don't Know / Unknown;
- Not Applicable;
- other application-defined non-scale states.

The pattern must visually and structurally separate these from an ordinal scale while preserving the same native radio group when they are mutually exclusive with scale values.

### P0: Validation message and summary
Patterns: `.ef-validation-message`, `.ef-validation-summary`

Requirements:

- question-level message;
- page/section/survey error summary;
- focusable summary for application-directed focus;
- links back to affected controls where appropriate;
- icon/text/non-color cues;
- stable heading;
- compatible with live insertion by Limen;
- no raw exception text as primary user communication.

### P0: Survey/task progress
Pattern: `.ef-survey-progress`

Requirements:

- native `progress` element for determinate progress;
- explicit accessible name;
- current/total text;
- optional section/context text;
- indeterminate variant when total is unknown;
- application supplies current value and progress semantics;
- progress must not infer domain completion.

### P1: Ranking
Visual contract: `.ef-ranking` (Limen behavior required)

Requirements:

- ordered list semantics;
- visible ordinal position;
- keyboard-operable move up/down or move-to-position path;
- drag-and-drop optional only;
- disabled boundary actions;
- live announcement contract for changed position;
- cancel/revert;
- small-item-set emphasis;
- application/Ordo owns uniqueness and ranking validation.

### P1: Allocation
Visual contract: `.ef-allocation` (Limen behavior required for aggregate validation)

Requirements:

- direct numeric entry for every allocation item;
- per-item min/max/step;
- visible aggregate total;
- explicit valid/invalid aggregate state supplied by application;
- remaining/excess amount presentation when applicable;
- no slider-only or drag-only allocation;
- application/Ordo owns total constraints and scoring.

### P1: Rule builder
Visual contract: `.ef-rule-builder` (Limen behavior required)

Requirements:

- field/operator/value clause layout;
- AND/OR group presentation;
- nested groups when justified;
- add/remove controls;
- keyboard operation;
- validation;
- plain-language meaning/preview;
- application owns typed expression semantics and serialization;
- design system shall not embed Signal-specific AST or rule meaning.

### P0: Obligation panel
Pattern/visual contract: `.ef-obligation-panel`

Requirements:

- unresolved obligation count;
- textual severity/type labels;
- blocking versus nonblocking distinction;
- obligation title and recovery/evidence description;
- action/navigation affordance supplied by application;
- unknown/unreconciled work can be represented distinctly;
- severity is not communicated by color alone;
- Ordo/application remains authority for whether obligations exist or are discharged.

### P0/P1: Selector completeness additions

The Signal SCS completeness pass establishes these additional reusable contracts:

- **Binary choice**: `.ef-binary-choice`, radio-backed so Unanswered remains distinct from No/False.
- **Semantic differential**: `.ef-semantic-differential`, textual bipolar endpoints with an ordinal radio scale.
- **Symbol rating**: `.ef-symbol-rating`, covering star/icon rating as ordinal presentation with non-icon accessible text.
- **Numeric stepper**: `.ef-numeric-stepper`, based on native number input.
- **Range entry**: `.ef-range-entry`, paired direct endpoint inputs; a graphical dual-thumb control is Limen enhancement only.
- **Image choice**: `.ef-choice--media`, reusing single/multi choice semantics with visible text.
- **Multi-choice guidance**: `.ef-selection-guidance`, `.ef-selection-status`, and `.ef-choice--exclusive` for exact/min/max/between and exclusive-option communication.
- **Matrix/repeated scale**: `.ef-matrix`, retaining row primitive semantics and decomposing to per-row controls on mobile.
- **Pairwise**: `.ef-pairwise`, a two-option choice presentation.
- **Best-Worst**: `.ef-best-worst`, a visual contract requiring Limen to enforce different Best/Worst selections.
- **Hierarchical choice**: `.ef-hierarchy`, native disclosure/choice baseline with application-owned parent/descendant semantics.

Ordinal scale cardinality shall include ordinary 3/4/5/6/7/10/11-point presentations. NPS, Likert, Agreement, Frequency, Satisfaction, Confidence, Maturity, and similar names remain presets/configuration, not duplicated components.

A checkbox-backed switch shall not be used for an assessment binary response when an untouched Unanswered state must remain distinct from false.

## 4. Navigation and command components

### P0: Tabs
Visual contract: `.ef-tabs` (Limen behavior required)

Support manual and automatic activation modes, overflow, deep-link integration hooks, keyboard navigation, and reduced-motion panel transitions.

The visual selected indicator uses Forma's light physics preset. Application/Limen updates tab semantics immediately; Forma only animates the resulting visual state.

### P0: Breadcrumbs
Prefer semantic nav/list markup with system styling. A component is optional for overflow collapsing.

### P0: Pagination
Support page navigation, unknown total count, cursor-style next/previous variants, compact mobile representation, and clear current-page semantics.

### P0: Application shell
Pattern: `.ef-app-shell`

Provide stable regions for header, navigation, main, contextual rail, footer, alerts, and transient overlays without owning application routing.

### P1: Side navigation
Pattern/visual contract: `.ef-side-nav`

Support nested groups, compact mode, responsive drawer mode, keyboard navigation, current-location semantics, and persistent versus transient behavior.

### P1: Toolbar
Pattern/visual contract: `.ef-toolbar`

Support roving keyboard focus when appropriate, overflow, separator semantics, contextual actions, and adaptive collapse.

### P1: Command palette
Visual contract: `.ef-command-palette` (Limen behavior required)

Requirements:

- keyboard-first open/close;
- search/filter;
- grouped actions;
- shortcut display;
- recently used and suggested sections supplied by application;
- async providers;
- disabled/unavailable commands with reason;
- no execution of hidden or unauthorized commands;
- focus restoration;
- optional nested command levels;
- mobile full-screen mode.

### P2: Tree navigation
Visual contract: `.ef-tree` (Limen behavior required)

Support expand/collapse, selection policy, keyboard tree interaction, async children, loading/error nodes, and large-tree performance.

## 5. Overlay and transient surfaces

### P0: Dialog
Pattern: `.ef-dialog` using native `dialog`

Use native dialog behavior where it satisfies requirements. Provide consistent focus management, labelled structure, destructive variants, scroll containment, responsive full-screen mode, and return-focus behavior.

Modal dialog motion uses the heavy physics preset by default, with a shorter derived exit. Native `[open]`, focus, Escape, inertness, and return focus remain authoritative.

### P0: Popover
Pattern: `.ef-popover` using native Popover HTML

Prefer the platform Popover API and CSS anchor positioning when available.

Support auto/light-dismiss and controlled/manual variants, placement fallback, collision handling, focus behavior, and top-layer animation.

Popover motion uses the light physics preset by default and preserves native `:popover-open` authority.

### P0: Tooltip
Declarative pattern where browser baseline supports it; otherwise visual contract

Tooltips are supplemental only. Required information and essential actions shall not exist only in a tooltip.

Support hover and keyboard focus, delayed open/close, pointer-safe hover travel, and reduced motion.

Implemented as `.ef-tooltip` (`patterns/tooltip.html`, FORMA-MOT-004):

- **Opening.** The native button opens the `popover` surface with `popovertarget`, by click, tap, Enter or Space. Escape and outside presses close it. No path depends on hover.
- **Hover and focus.** Where interest invokers exist, `interestfor` on the same button also opens it on hover or focus. The browser owns the delay and pointer-safe hover travel.
- **Placement.** Anchor positioning with `flip-block`/`flip-inline` fallbacks keeps it in the viewport. Without support, the browser's top-layer placement remains readable.
- **Motion.** Light weight, tiny origin displacement, perceptual opacity, and a shorter exit. Reduced motion removes the displacement.
- **Boundaries.** Focus, dismissal, timeout and accessible-description policy beyond the native popover remain application/Limen concerns.

### P0: Menu and menu button
Pattern: `.ef-menu` for ordinary action lists using native Popover HTML; full ARIA menu behavior remains a Limen visual/behavior contract.

The declarative baseline supports ordinary buttons/links, native Popover open/close, responsive mobile presentation, and the light physics preset.

When menu semantics require checkable items, radio groups, typeahead, roving focus, nested submenus, or the ARIA `menu` keyboard model, Limen/application behavior owns those semantics.

### P1: Context menu
Visual contract: `.ef-context-menu` (Limen behavior required)

Must always have a non-context-menu path to essential actions.

### P0: Flyout
Pattern: `.ef-flyout` using native `dialog` for modal flyouts

Support left and right edge placement, native modal focus/inertness/Escape behavior, labelled header/body/action regions, scroll containment, safe-area-aware mobile sizing, physics-derived entry/exit, and reduced motion.

The left and right variants are one component contract selected with `data-ef-side="left|right"`, not separate components. Native modal behavior remains browser-owned. Optional swipe-to-close, drag tracking, resizing, or persistent nonmodal state belongs to Limen/application behavior.

### P1: Drawer / sheet
Pattern: `.ef-flyout` using native `dialog` for the modal left/right baseline; Limen/application behavior is required for nonmodal or gesture-enhanced variants.

The existing flyout contract is Forma's canonical modal drawer/side-sheet implementation. Support left and right placement, responsive adaptation, native focus/inertness/Escape behavior, and reduced-motion entry/exit.

The modal baseline uses the heavy physics preset and enters from its occupied edge. Swipe is optional enhancement only and may never be the only close path. Bottom-sheet, persistent nonmodal, resizable, and gesture-tracked variants remain application/Limen concerns until separately proven.

### P1: Toggletip
Declarative popover pattern where sufficient

For interactive explanatory content that is too important or interactive for a tooltip.

### P1: Coachmark / guided tour
Visual contract: `.ef-coachmark` (Limen behavior required)

Support:

- target anchoring;
- step count;
- next/back/skip;
- action-dependent advancement;
- focus management;
- escape and dismissal policy;
- target missing state;
- responsive placement;
- persistent progress supplied by the application;
- reduced-motion transitions.

Tours shall never block access to the underlying feature merely because onboarding state is missing.

## 6. Feedback and status

### P0
- ef-alert
- ef-inline-message
- ef-toast
- ef-progress-bar
- ef-progress-circle
- ef-spinner
- ef-skeleton
- ef-empty-state
- ef-error-summary

Requirements include semantic live-region policy, duplicate-announcement prevention, determinate/indeterminate distinction, pause/dismiss policy, and unknown outcome support.

Implemented loading/progress contracts (FORMA-MOT-005, MOT-016/MOT-017):

- `.ef-spinner` (`patterns/spinner.html`): a visible label in a `role="status"` region plus a decorative indicator rotating at the named cadence `--ef-motion-cadence-rotation-period`; `data-ef-state="idle"` stops it; static under reduced motion.
- `.ef-progress` (`patterns/progress-bar.html`): native `progress` projected directly from the authoritative value with no transition, so it never shows more than the application reports; the indeterminate variant keeps explicit text.
- `.ef-skeleton` shimmers at `--ef-motion-cadence-period` only while `aria-busy="true"`.

Alert and toast motion requirements:

- `.ef-alert[data-ef-motion-entry]` may use a standard-weight entry cue when newly inserted;
- persistent alerts do not repeatedly animate by default;
- `.ef-toast` may use the native Popover API as a zero-runtime show/hide baseline;
- toast dismissal uses the shorter derived exit duration;
- notification motion never replaces visible status text or live-region semantics;
- reduced motion removes spatial travel.

### P1: Async action button pattern
This may be a pattern around a native button rather than a custom element.

States: ready, pending, succeeded, failed.

The visual success state must not substitute for durable application confirmation.

### P1: Undo notification
Support a bounded undo window without requiring the user to act before reading the message.

## 7. Data and productivity

### P0: Data table styling
Static and lightly interactive tables shall remain semantic HTML.

### P1: Data grid
Visual contract: `.ef-data-grid` (Limen behavior required for interactive grid)

Requirements:

- sortable columns;
- filter integration;
- column visibility;
- resizable columns;
- reorderable columns with non-drag alternative;
- row selection;
- keyboard grid navigation;
- sticky header;
- pagination or virtualization strategy;
- loading/skeleton rows;
- empty/error states;
- density modes;
- inline actions;
- accessible row and cell labeling;
- horizontal overflow handling;
- persisted user preferences supplied by application.

### P2: Editable data grid
Add:

- cell and row edit modes;
- commit/cancel semantics;
- validation;
- dirty state;
- conflict presentation;
- optimistic/pessimistic integration hooks;
- bulk edit;
- undo where feasible.

This component has meaningful internal state and should receive an explicit Ordo-style state model.

### P2: Tree grid
Visual contract: `.ef-tree` (Limen behavior required)-grid

Combine hierarchy and tabular data only after the keyboard and screen-reader model is proven against WAI-ARIA expectations.

### P1: List and virtual list
Static list pattern; `.ef-virtual-list` requires Limen behavior

Virtualization is optional and must never become the default for small lists.

### P1: Filter builder
Visual contract: `.ef-filter-builder` (Limen behavior required)

Support composable field/operator/value clauses, nested groups where justified, keyboard editing, validation, removable clauses, and application-owned expression serialization.

### P2: Query/search builder
A more advanced rule-expression UI may extend the filter builder but shall not embed application-specific expression semantics.

### P1: Sort builder
Support multi-column priority ordering and non-drag reordering.

### P1: Bulk action bar
Appears based on selection state, announces selection count, exposes legal actions supplied by application, and remains keyboard reachable.

### P1: Timeline / activity feed
Support grouped timestamps, status changes, expandable detail, source attribution, and virtual loading if needed.

### P1: Diff viewer
Support text/structured differences, additions/removals/changes, keyboard navigation between changes, and non-color cues.

## 8. Layout and workspace components

### P0
- page shell;
- section;
- card;
- panel;
- header;
- footer;
- divider;
- scroll container;
- sticky action region.

### P1: Resizable split pane
Visual contract: `.ef-split-pane` (Limen behavior required)

Implemented presentation (FORMA-MOT-006):

- `patterns/resizable-split-pane.html`: `data-ef-resizable`, an application-supplied `--ef-split-size` clamped to legal bounds in CSS, a focusable `role="separator"` with value semantics, and direct tracking while `data-ef-manipulation="resizing"`.
- Damped settling on release or keyboard step; `data-ef-collapsed`.
- Stacked without the separator at narrow widths.
- Pointer and keyboard behavior remain Limen/application code.

Requirements:

- pointer drag;
- keyboard resizing;
- collapse/expand;
- minimum pane sizes;
- saved size supplied by application;
- double-click reset option;
- visible resize handle;
- no drag-only requirement;
- reduced-motion collapse/restore.

### P1: Responsive drawer layout
Supports navigation/content/detail compositions that transition between multi-pane desktop and stacked/mobile presentation without changing semantic order unnecessarily.

### P2: Dockable panels
Only if multiple applications demonstrate need. Docking must not become a general desktop-window framework by default.

## 9. Content and utility components

### P0
- badge;
- tag/chip;
- avatar;
- icon;
- icon button pattern;
- card/tile;
- accordion/disclosure (FORMA-MOT-007: intrinsic-height settling via `interpolate-size` and `::details-content` where supported, instant elsewhere);
- scroll progress: `.ef-scroll-progress` (FORMA-MOT-007), a decorative direct projection of the scroll timeline;
- key-value list;
- stat/metric (FORMA-MOT-011: `data-ef-value-change` marks an application-published update with a neutral perceptual tint; values are never counted through);
- code block with copy action;
- keyboard shortcut display;
- separator.

### P1
- stepper / progress indicator;
- timeline;
- status lozenge;
- meter;
- rating display/input if justified;
- copyable field;
- expandable text;
- relative-time display.

### P2
- syntax-highlighted editor shell adapter;
- rich text editor shell adapter.

The design system should style and integrate editors rather than invent a full text editor engine without a demonstrated need.

## 10. Visualization

### P1: Visualization tokens
Define categorical, sequential, diverging, positive/negative, threshold, focus, and selection color tokens.

### P2: Small visualization primitives
Potential components:

- sparkline;
- progress ring;
- simple bar;
- simple line;
- distribution strip;
- status matrix.

### P2: Chart accessibility contract
Any chart implementation shall provide an equivalent data representation, keyboard access where interaction exists, text summaries where meaningful, and non-color distinctions.

The design system shall not become a full charting framework unless application requirements demonstrate that need.

## 11. Specialized interaction patterns

### P1: Reorderable list
Visual contract: `.ef-reorder-list` (Limen behavior required)

Support drag, keyboard move up/down or position controls, live announcement of movement, auto-scroll, drop indicators, and cancel/revert.

### P2: Transfer list
Visual contract: `.ef-transfer-list` (Limen behavior required)

Support moving items between sets without requiring drag-and-drop.

### P2: Editable key/value collection
For metadata, tags, environment variables, and configuration where pair editing is common.

### P1: Step-by-step wizard shell
Visual contract: `.ef-wizard` (Limen/Ordo behavior required)

Supports:

- explicit step state;
- optional branching supplied by application;
- validation before advance;
- save/exit;
- resume;
- previous-step policy;
- progress;
- incomplete/error states.

Business transition legality remains application/Ordo owned.

## 12. Zero-runtime rule

No catalog entry authorizes JavaScript or WebAssembly inside the design-system package.

If an entry requires behavior beyond semantic HTML, its behavior belongs to Limen/application code while this repository owns only markup/CSS/accessibility/communication contracts.

## 13. Explicit non-goals

Do not automatically build:

- a custom replacement for every native element;
- a general-purpose rich text editor;
- a full charting engine;
- a spreadsheet engine;
- a window manager;
- application-specific workflow controls;
- a framework-specific wrapper as the canonical API.

Those may be added only after concrete application evidence.


## 14. Cross-application operational compositions

These contracts are promoted by repeated requirements across Chrona/time-tracking, Signal, Summa, Sales & Marketing, HelixNote, and Research Publisher. See `requirements/CROSS-APPLICATION-COMPONENT-WAVE.md`.

### P0/P1: Collection toolbar
Pattern: `.ef-collection-toolbar`

Compose search, filter entry, sort, result count, saved view, and optional view mode. On mobile, search remains prominent and secondary controls recompose without hiding active state.

### P1: Conflict review
Pattern: `.ef-conflict-review`

Compose version/current-state comparison, changed facts, explanatory consequence, and application-supplied recovery actions. Domain merge legality remains application/Ordo owned.

### P0: Metric card and dashboard grid
Patterns: `.ef-metric-card`, `.ef-dashboard-grid`

Provide responsive operational summaries without assigning analytical meaning. Dashboard content order remains application supplied.

### P0/P1: Work queue
Pattern: `.ef-work-queue`

Present attention-required work with reason, context, status, age/due information, and application-supplied legal actions. This generalizes the obligation presentation without making Forma authoritative over obligations.

### P0/P1: Operation status
Pattern: `.ef-operation-status`

Present pending, confirmed, failed, conflict, unknown, reconciling, stale, blocked, unavailable, and insufficient-data states with explicit text and non-color cues.

### P1: Readiness checklist
Pattern: `.ef-readiness-checklist`

Present complete, incomplete, warning, and blocking prerequisites before an application-owned transition. Forma does not calculate readiness.

### P0: Record header
Pattern: `.ef-record-header`

Provide stable record identity, type, status, context, breadcrumbs, and action region. Secondary actions may collapse on mobile; critical actions remain reachable.

### P1: Master/detail workspace
Pattern: `.ef-master-detail`

Provide responsive list/detail composition. The application owns selection, routing, browser history, and focus restoration.

### P1: Provenance trail
Pattern: `.ef-provenance-trail`

Present a trace through source, aggregate, analysis, derivation, and presentation stages using application-supplied facts.

### P1: Preview surface
Pattern: `.ef-preview-surface`

Provide a bounded review surface for consequential content before publish/issue/send/commit operations. Preview presentation never implies authorization.

### P0/P1: Mobile action bar
Pattern: `.ef-mobile-action-bar`

Provide a safe-area-aware contextual action region for narrow screens. It must not cover focused content or become the only path to essential actions on wider layouts.

## 15. Mobile completeness

Every implemented component is subject to `requirements/MOBILE-COMPONENT-CONTRACT.md`.

A component is not complete until its 320px presentation is documented and tested. Mobile is a recomposition of the same semantic contract, not a separate component family.


## 16. Aegis fault presentation

### P0: Aegis fault presentation family

Canonical patterns:

- `.ef-fault` / `fault`: common safe fault shell;
- `.ef-fault--inline` / `fault-inline`: Aegis Inline intent;
- `.ef-fault-notification` / `fault-notification`: Aegis Notification intent;
- `.ef-fault-banner` / `fault-banner`: Aegis Banner intent;
- `.ef-fault-blocking` / `fault-blocking`: Aegis Blocking intent;
- `.ef-fault-summary` / `fault-summary`: grouped unresolved fault presentation;
- `.ef-recovery-actions` / `recovery-actions`: application-supplied Aegis recovery capabilities;
- `.ef-fault-reference` / `fault-reference`: quotable Aegis reference;
- `.ef-diagnostic-status` / `diagnostic-status`: Aegis persistence/synchronization state;
- `.ef-fault-details` / `fault-details`: explicitly sanitized diagnostic disclosure.

Requirements:

- default data boundary is Aegis `Presentation.T`, not raw `Fault`;
- `Silent` renders no visible fault surface;
- severity is textual and structural, never color-only;
- recovery buttons carry exact Aegis capability identity but do not authorize effects;
- current Aegis/Ordo/application state is revalidated at activation;
- raw technical details, exception chains, stack traces, context, breadcrumbs, snapshots, and secrets are excluded from normal UI;
- blocking presentation uses native dialog semantics with application/Limen-owned modal lifecycle and close policy;
- summary grouping/fingerprinting/throttling remain Aegis/application responsibilities;
- notification timers are not part of Forma;
- every pattern satisfies the canonical 320px, reduced-motion, forced-colors, keyboard, and WCAG 2.2 AA contracts.

See `requirements/AEGIS-FAULT-PRESENTATION.md`.

## 17. Terminal / character-grid family

### P1: CharacterGrid presentation family

Canonical patterns:

- `.ef-character-grid` / `character-grid`: fixed rows × columns grid with cell-coordinate runs, contained narrow-screen viewport, subgrid groups, positioned tables;
- `character-grid-field`: protected text and native editable fields;
- `character-grid-keys`: Enter, Clear, Reset, PF1–PF24, and named action affordances;
- `character-grid-status`: message and system-status live regions; optional device status rows after the application rows (`data-ef-status-rows`, CG-18);
- `character-grid-selection`: per-row selection fields in positioned repeated rows (5250-style option column);
- `character-grid-reveal`: optional SequentialReveal presentation;
- `character-grid-3270`: IBM 3270 reference profile (24 × 80 plus an OIA status row, verified at 32 × 80);
- `character-grid-workflow`: Customer Inquiry → Account Detail → Transaction History reference application.

Requirements:

- not a 3270 component: geometry, key vocabulary, and profile are parameters; profiles change presentation only;
- source order is row-major order; no positive `tabindex`, no inline `style`;
- conformance rules CG-1…CG-18 are enforced by `tools/character-grid-conformance.mjs`;
- Forma presents actions and status; key mapping, Enter/Clear/Reset/PF processing, transitions, input inhibition, and reveal orchestration belong to Limen/application code; legality belongs to Ordo;
- contained horizontal scrolling only inside a named, focusable viewport; never page-level overflow; opt-in reflow;
- rows ≥ 24px (WCAG 2.5.8) and ≥ 44px on narrow/coarse-pointer screens;
- 320/390 px, 200 % text, forced colors, reduced motion, and automated WCAG A/AA verified.

See `requirements/CHARACTER-GRID.md` and `docs/CHARACTER-GRID-AUTHORING.md`.


## Marketing presentation family (GH-49)

Implemented patterns for Echelon marketing and public sites:

- `marketing-shell`: the MarketingShell frame (skip link, identity header, primary navigation, main, footer);
- `site-header`, `site-footer`;
- `hero`, `section-heading`, `cta`;
- `card-grid`, `facts`, `entry-index`, `steps`, `badge`;
- `prose`, `code-sample`;
- `documentation-layout`.

Requirements:

- generic and brand-neutral; the Echelon look comes from the Echelon Marketing Theme's tokens;
- marketing foundations apply only inside `.ef-site`;
- surface tones (`data-ef-tone`) carry contrast-safe text, link, label, and rule colors;
- one primary action per hero, section, or CTA;
- the navigation wraps instead of hiding destinations;
- 44 px targets; no CSS reordering;
- verified at 320/390 px, 200 % text, text spacing, forced colors, reduced motion, print, and WCAG 2.2 A/AA.

See `requirements/MARKETING-PRESENTATION.md` and `docs/MARKETING-SITES.md`.


## 18. Object metadata and diagram/workflow presentation

See `requirements/OBJECT-METADATA-AND-DIAGRAM-PRESENTATION.md`.

### P0/P1: Metadata presentation

Forma SHOULD support a reusable metadata presentation recipe for consumer-supplied descriptive fields such as identifiers, descriptions, tags, owners/roles, phases, status text, source/provenance references, versions, dates, links, and namespaced custom values.

Requirements:

- metadata remains application/profile supplied;
- metadata is not authorization, workflow legality, scoring, or domain truth;
- object identity is independent of labels, geometry, and color;
- compact and expanded metadata presentation should reuse semantic HTML such as description lists, lists, links, and time;
- applications choose which metadata fields are safe to render;
- hidden DOM attributes are not the canonical metadata store;
- secrets/suppressed values must not be placed in presentation attributes;
- long/localized/RTL metadata must reflow and remain readable.

### P1: Diagram/workflow object presentation

Candidate patterns/visual contracts:

- `.ef-diagram`;
- `.ef-diagram-node`;
- `.ef-diagram-connector`;
- `.ef-diagram-connector-label`;
- `.ef-diagram-group` / boundary;
- `.ef-diagram-lane`;
- `.ef-diagram-phase`;
- `.ef-diagram-legend`;
- `.ef-diagram-metadata`.

These names are architecture candidates until the first implementation slice proves the smallest stable public surface.

Requirements:

- Forma owns only reusable presentation;
- Studio/application owns graph topology, geometry, routing, hit testing, drag/drop, selection, commands/history, profile semantics, workflow execution, and validation;
- editor-only adorners are not part of exported production presentation;
- presentation works with HTML/SVG composition and does not introduce Forma runtime JavaScript;
- one visual pattern may represent multiple semantic kinds when the consumer explicitly maps them.

### P1: Authored workflow/diagram color

Eligible workflow/diagram objects MUST be colorable.

Forma presentation MUST support:

- fill/background treatment;
- border/stroke treatment;
- accent treatment;
- connector stroke/accent treatment;
- optional foreground treatment when contrast is valid;
- Forma token defaults;
- project/brand palette slots;
- explicit consumer-authored color overrides where the consuming product permits them.

Color is presentation, not semantic authority.

- a red object is not automatically an error;
- a green object is not automatically approved;
- semantic status/type and color remain independent;
- explicit metadata-to-color mapping belongs to the consumer/profile;
- meaningful distinctions require text/icon/shape/line-style/pattern/marker cues in addition to color;
- forced colors, grayscale, dark/light themes, and backgrounds-disabled print must remain understandable;
- authored color must never erase focus-visible, selected, validation, or disabled cues.

### P1: Metadata-driven decorations

Metadata MAY be projected into badges, labels, icons, markers, bars, or similar decorations when the consumer supplies an explicit mapping.

The underlying metadata remains authoritative. Forma decorations are projections only and must have textual/structural equivalents when meaningful.


## Motion-driven catalog addition: tooltip / contextual hint

### P1: Tooltip / contextual hint

Visual contract: `.ef-tooltip` or the final canonical slug selected during implementation. Native/application behavior is required unless the chosen browser primitive supplies the complete interaction contract.

Requirements:

- ordinary visible help text remains preferred when the information is important enough to keep on screen;
- transient content must have a non-hover-only access path;
- keyboard focus and pointer access must expose equivalent information;
- the tooltip/hint may not contain a critical action that disappears with the surface;
- placement must remain within the dynamic viewport and adapt when the preferred side cannot fit;
- presentation must preserve an explicit relationship to its invoker;
- motion follows MOT-018 in `requirements/MOTION-AND-INTERACTION.md`;
- reduced motion removes spatial travel;
- content, open/close behavior, dismissal policy, delay policy, accessible description relationships, and focus behavior remain native/application responsibilities;
- the surface must not become semantic authority or imply validation, severity, confidence, or permission.
