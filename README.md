# Echelon Design System

Shared design-system infrastructure for Echelon Foundry applications.

This repository is governed by the Echelon engineering capability stack:

- State-Directed Engineering / Ordo
- Repository Operating System (ROS)
- Visual Engineering
- Communication Engineering

The design system will provide shared visual foundations, reusable browser-native components, application patterns, accessibility contracts, behavioral state models where warranted, and integration points for Echelon applications.

Repository requirements and implementation work should be captured through ROS and shaped by Ordo rather than treating the component catalog as the source of domain truth.

Current capability baseline:

- SDE / Ordo 1.3.0
- ROS 3.1.4
- Visual Engineering 1.0.0
- Communication Engineering 1.0.0


## Forma

**Forma** is the product name for this Echelon Foundry design system. The package identifier is `@echelon-foundry/design-system`. Forma 0.1.0 is the first application-consumption baseline.

Forma is intentionally zero-runtime. Semantic HTML, CSS, design tokens,
accessibility contracts, and visual patterns live here. Behavior beyond
browser-native interaction belongs to the consuming application, normally
through Limen.

Build the component documentation site with:

```bash
npm run site:check
```

The generated GitHub Pages artifact is written to `site-dist/`.
Agent usage rules are in [docs/AGENT-USAGE.md](docs/AGENT-USAGE.md).


Public component examples use readable inert `<ef-*>` authoring tags around
the canonical native HTML:

```html
<ef-switch class="ef-component-tag">
  <label class="ef-switch">
    <input class="ef-switch__input" type="checkbox" role="switch">
    <span class="ef-switch__track" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="ef-switch__text">
      <span class="ef-switch__label">Notifications</span>
    </span>
  </label>
</ef-switch>
```

The wrapper is not registered with `customElements.define()`; Forma remains
zero-runtime and the native HTML inside the tag owns semantics and interaction.


## Application consumption

Applications must consume a pinned Forma release rather than copying CSS or
tracking the repository branch. See
[docs/CONSUMING-FORMA.md](docs/CONSUMING-FORMA.md) for the canonical dependency,
ownership boundaries, mobile rules, and upgrade procedure.

A version tag builds and validates the exact package archive, exercises it in a
clean consumer, and attaches the tarball to the GitHub release. npm publishing
may be enabled through Trusted Publishing without changing the application
contract.

## Marketing sites

Forma is the shared presentation system for every Echelon marketing website.
The Echelon Foundry site is the visual reference, and each site consumes the
same pinned artifacts:

- the MarketingShell;
- the brand-neutral marketing components and layouts;
- the Echelon Marketing Theme.

Start with `docs/MARKETING-SITES.md` and the reference fixture in
`examples/echelon-marketing-site`.

## Branding and skins

Forma supports versioned, scoped white-label presentation through Brand
Manifests and zero-runtime skin presets. Brand manifests compile to static CSS
custom-property scopes; applications retain runtime selection/persistence and
domain authority.

See [docs/BRANDING.md](docs/BRANDING.md) and
[requirements/WHITE-LABEL-AND-SKINNING.md](requirements/WHITE-LABEL-AND-SKINNING.md).


## Aegis fault presentation

Forma includes a zero-runtime fault presentation family for Aegis `Presentation.T`: inline, notification, banner, blocking, summary, recovery actions, references, safe details, and diagnostic persistence status.

Applications should map Aegis through the safe presentation model rather than bind a raw `Fault`. Recovery actions remain application/Ordo authorized and Limen-executed.

See [docs/AEGIS-INTEGRATION.md](docs/AEGIS-INTEGRATION.md) and [requirements/AEGIS-FAULT-PRESENTATION.md](requirements/AEGIS-FAULT-PRESENTATION.md).


## Object metadata and diagram/workflow presentation

Forma now explicitly treats descriptive object metadata and diagram/workflow presentation as reusable cross-cutting capabilities.

Objects may carry consumer-supplied metadata such as identifiers, descriptions, tags, owner/role, phase/category, status text, provenance/source references, and custom namespaced fields. Forma may present selected metadata, but the consuming application/profile remains the authority for values and meaning.

Workflow/diagram items may also carry authored fill, border/stroke, accent, connector, and safe foreground colors. Color is presentation only. Semantic workflow type/status never derives from color, and meaningful distinctions must survive forced colors, grayscale, and backgrounds-disabled output.

See `requirements/OBJECT-METADATA-AND-DIAGRAM-PRESENTATION.md`.
